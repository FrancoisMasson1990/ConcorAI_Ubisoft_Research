I am using dlib supplied "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat"

You still need to download dlib model file: "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat"

This is a location where that file is hosted: https://github.com/AKSHAYUBHAT/TensorFace/blob/master/openface/models/dlib/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
